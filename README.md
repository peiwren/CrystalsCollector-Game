Crystal Collector is a web application that allows users to play a game where they gain points by clicking different crystals. You win the game by matching your total score to the random given number at the start of the game. You lose if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game restarts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
